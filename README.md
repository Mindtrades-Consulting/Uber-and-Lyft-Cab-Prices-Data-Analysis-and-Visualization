# Uber-and-Lyft-Cab-Prices-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization
Both Uber and Lyft are ride-hailing services that allow users to hire vehicles with drivers through websites or mobile apps. Uber is a global company available in 69 countries and around 900 cities worldwide. Lyft, on the other hand, operates in about 644 cities in the US and 12 cities in Canada only. Yet, in the US, it’s the second-largest ridesharing company with a 31% market share. 
From booking the cab to paying the bill, both services have almost similar core features. But there are some unique cases where the two ride-hailing services come neck to neck. One such is pricing, especially dynamic pricing called “surge” in Uber and “Prime Time” in Lyft. 
We have an interesting dataset with data from Boston (US), which we will analyze to understand the factors affecting the dynamic pricing and the difference between Uber and Lyft’s special prices. 
# Data source
The datasets used in this article have been imported from:
[Kaggle]
The data has been collected from different sources, including real-time data collection using Uber and Lyft API (Application Programming Interface) queries. The dataset covers Boston’s selected locations and covers approximately a week’s data from November 2018. 
After loading the dataset, we found two files available. The first is the weather.csv, and the second is cab_rides.csv. 
# Data Analysis
The data has been analyzed using Python and visualized with Power BI. For a similar analysis where the data is updated regularly, we recommend using www.datom.ai, a code-free tool with usage-based pricing that allows for scheduling importing of data, data cleansing, data syndication, and other features. 
# Factors affecting cab prices
1. Distance and price correlation
2. Surge correlation with days
3. Surge correlation with time of the day
4. Surge correlation with source and destination
5. Ride correlation with weather
# Summary
If you were a Business Analyst working for either Uber or Lyft, you could draw the following conclusions:
1. Uber is more economical; however, Lyft also provides fair competition.
2. People prefer to have shared rides during the nighttime.
3. People avoid taking rides when it rains.
4. When traveling at longer distances, the price does not increase linearly. However, based on the time and demand, a surge can affect the cost.
5. Uber can be the first choice for long distances.
